A repo I used to help a beginner learning code/C++.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
1. Open repo with VSCode, open in devcontainer
1. In new terminal in devcontainer, run `make run` command

## Tools used:
* `git` -> The defacto standard for working with source code.
* `GitHub` -> The most popular website for collboration on `git` repositories.
* `GitHub Desktop` -> To set up local authentication to GitHub.
* `VSCode` -> A simpler version of Visual Studio
* `make` -> A pretty universal tool for abstracting away compilation and executable generation commands.
* `devcontainers` -> A standard way to define a virtual development environment for a project. [Read more here.](https://containers.dev/). Requires docker.
